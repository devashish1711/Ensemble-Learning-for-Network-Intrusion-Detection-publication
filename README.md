## 📄 Review Report

### ✅ **Summary**
This study proposes a hybrid ensemble approach combining traditional machine learning models (SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests) with a Feature Tokenizer Transformer (FT-Transformer) for network intrusion detection. Evaluated on a simulated US Air Force LAN dataset, the proposed FT-Transformer and voting classifier achieved **99.78% accuracy** and **99.75% recall**.

---

### 🟩 Major Strengths
1. Integration of FT-Transformer with ensemble methods significantly enhances detection accuracy.
2. Comprehensive use of evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).
3. Clear description of data preprocessing and methodology.
4. High relevance to military and defense network applications.

---

### 🟥 Weaknesses
- FT-Transformer’s high computational demands may impact real-time performance.
- Lacks a deeper discussion on adaptation to **evolving threats** or **zero-day attacks**.

---

### 🟨 Minor Suggestions
- Clarify the **feature selection process**.
- Briefly discuss challenges in **real-world deployment** and scalability.

---

### 🏁 Final Recommendation
**✅ Accepted**  
The manuscript presents a **novel and well-evaluated** approach to intrusion detection using a hybrid of FT-Transformer and classical learning models.
